# ConsoleShop

## Steps to get started

- Clone the **Repository**

  ```git
  https://github.com/Jiseeeh/ConsoleShop.git
  ```

- Open it in your ***favorite editor***

- Run **Main.java**

- Login using this:

    - `username:` **owner**

    - `password:` **123**

- You can now add products!

- Register customers and test it!

## My prof's suggestion
- Make a separate class for the `lists`
- Remove product's quantity properties, because it represents a single product.
  - because having that property there, it would look like an inventory.
